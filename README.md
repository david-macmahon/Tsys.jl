# Tsys

This package can be used to compute the *system temperature* of a radio
telescope.  The current functionality uses measurements of RF power when the
radio telescope of a given diameter is pointed at (ON) and away from (OFF) an
astrophysical source of radio emission with known flux density.  Additional
parameters, such as the aperture efficiency and atmospheric opacity, have
default values that will provide qualitative results, but they may be supplied
to get quantitative results if desired.
